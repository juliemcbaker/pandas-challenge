Unsurprisingly, as the largest gender group, males spent much more ($1967.64) overall in-game than the other groups (females = $361.94, other/non-disclosed = $50.19). A more interesting trend is that males actually spent less ($4.07) on average than either females ($4.67) or other/non-disclosed individuals ($4.57).

In terms of spending per age group, as should be expected, the largest age group, 20-24 year olds (n = 365) cumulatively spent the most money in-game ($1114.06). When looking at amount spent per player, 20-24 year olds actually came in third place, spending on average $4.32 each behind kids under ten (n = 23), who averaged $4.54 each, and 35-39 year olds (n = 41), who averaged the highest at $4.76 each.

In terms of the items purchased, only three items were in the Top 5 for both Most Popular and Most Profitable. Final Critic was #1 on both lists selling 13 units, with overall value of $59.99. Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm was #2 on both lists selling 12 units, with overall value of $50.76. Finally, Fiery Glass Crusader came in at #3 for most popular items, selling 9 units and was #4 on the profit list with overall value of $41.22.
